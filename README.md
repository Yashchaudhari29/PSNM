This file consists of diffrent types of methods used for finding roots of given equations. Now we are going to see those methods one by one with code implementation.

BISECTION METHOD:
The bisection method is used to find the roots of a polynomial equation. It separates the interval and subdivides the interval in which the root of the equation lies. The principle behind this method is the intermediate theorem for continuous functions.

REGULA FALSE METHOD:
An ancient method of solving an equation in one variable is the false position method (method of false position) or regula falsi method. In simple words, the method is described as the trial and error approach of using “false” or “test” values for the variable and then altering the test value according to the result.
