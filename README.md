This file consists of diffrent types of methods used for finding roots of given equations. Now we are going to see those methods one by one with code implementation.

BISECTION METHOD:
The bisection method is used to find the roots of a polynomial equation. It separates the interval and subdivides the interval in which the root of the equation lies. The principle behind this method is the intermediate theorem for continuous functions.
